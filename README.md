### :smiley: About Jeehay
Hi, weclome to my page. According to the **six degrees of separation**, we all are six or fewer social connections away from each other. 
The idea led me to join the event management industry and I passionately spent 10+ years communicating with all walks of life. 
Event/meeting management is all about communication. 
I always was interested in the process of developing a website or a mobile application for better communication. 
It took many years for me to decide to start learning programing languages by myself. 
My decision may sound unexpected, but it is like simply changing a role. I was a meeting/event planner, but now I hope to be a web/mobile app developer and ideally a software engineer for better communication.
