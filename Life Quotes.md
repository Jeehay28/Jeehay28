# Life Quotes and my two cents

### ☕ Disappointment 
> "We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope."   -Martin Luther King, Jr.  

I know that disappointment is inevitable as long as I am alive. In my case, disappointment always led to parting, which led to a new beginning. Disappointment only happens after you reach a certain level that you expected. It is sad but seems unavoidable. You can't go far without hope, but you can be disappointed when you arrive.


### 🥖 Let your mind relax
> "Your mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer."
  -William S. Burroughs, American writer

Your mind needs complete rest as much as your body needs. It's like charging a battery. It takes time and energy for your mind to figure out what your question is about, too.

### 🍎 Maturity
> "Self-knowledge is the first step to maturity."
  -Jane Austen
  
Knowing yourself takes tremendous courage to see yourself. You may be disappointed that you are not what you expect. Maturity in this sense is optional and, unlike inevitable aging, can be avoided.

### 🍀 Start small
> "Cumulatively small decisions, choices, actions, make a very big difference." 
  -Jane Goodall
  
Whatever it is, start small. Once you start, never stop. Then the result will be large enough.

### 🍍 Unhappy for other people's success?
> "Never hate jealous people. They are jealous because they think you are better than them."
> -Paulo Coelho

Sometimes it's hard to sincerely celebrate someone's success or happiness. Is it because I'm jealous of them? Maybe it is. But it is more like not accepting the happiness or success that comes from the sacrifice of others.


### 🍊 Products at best
> "Competition brings out the best in products and the worst in people."
> -David Sarnoff, American businessman

What can you expect from people treated as a product? If you give up being a person and turn into a product, you become the best. The worst happens when you try to find human behaviour in the product.

### 🐈 Decision making
> "Clutter is symptomatic of delayed decision making."
> -Cynthia Kyriazis, Productivity & Organization Consultant

Decluttering is not an easy task. It requires decision making whether it's small or big. And we will only know in time whether it is the right decision or not.


### 🍞 Fiction
> "Fiction reveals truths that reality obscures." 
> -Ralph Waldo Emerson, American essayist

Fictional stories ironically tell some moments that are easily ignored in reality. And they also tell the truth that we cannot speak directly in reality for whatever reason. Despite the warning that they are not true, they have the power to lead us to the truth.


### 🥑 Money or work
> "If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."
> -Warren Buffett

There was a time when I liked to work. I did seem to focus on career development rather than making money. I was so naive back then. But now I want to make money without working.

### 🍺 Reasonable doubt
> "Blinded belief in authority is the greatest enemy of truth."
> -Albert Einstein

If you are shocked by fake news, you will start reconsidering your way of accepting news without reasonable doubt. Blind faith often prevents us from seeing the truth. What we really need is reasonable doubt. Especially when fake news is all around us.

### ☕ Happy for no reason
> "Be happy for no reason, like a child.
> If you are happy for a reason, you’re in trouble, because that reason can be taken from you."
> -Deepak Chopra, Indian-American author

I always thought there was a reason for every emotion, whether it's good or bad. It's a bit strange to me to feel good for no reason. I can't remember a time when I felt that way for no reason. Nevertheless, it's good to feel good for no reason.

### 🎂 Minimalist
> "I am a minimalist. I like saying the most with the least."

We usually put a lot of effort into gift wrapping. However, for the gift to be visible, the bulky packaging must be removed, and the gift is treasured, but the wrapping paper is discarded.

### 🍏 A tip for happiness
> "The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less."

What would the world be like if we all experienced true happiness from having less? Who knows? But I can at least say that the problems we are experiencing now will not be a problem anymore.

### 🚡 Inevitable sadness
> "Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth."

Given the fact that I get sad every day, I may be becoming a better person. 😅

### 🍎 Jealousy
> "You can only be jealous of someone who has something you think you ought to have yourself."
> -Margaret Atwood

I don't know why that memory suddenly came to mind. I felt it was unfair for her to get help from her seniors through friendship. Looking back on what I did, what I did was not much different from what she did, which was also unfair. I may have envied her because I had no close relationship with them. Up until now, I thought she was a greedy opportunist without realizing that if she was that kind of person, so was I. What a powerful jealousy! Enough to blind me from seeing my own faults.

### 🐦 Birds chirping

Birds wake up in the extremely early morning and break the silence of the night with their beautiful voices. I really wonder what they talk about, but just listening to their chirping makes me marvel at nature.

I always thought that my dreams were limited by other people or that there were obstacles to my success. But essentially, I myself can be either a problem or a solution, so I can choose which one to be.


### 🐡 Seeing is what makes it exist

### 🌭 Respect

I believe that keeping all kinds of human relationships depend on respect for each other. The fact that even respect earned over the years can be lost in a day proves this.

Suddenly I was scared but I didn't know why... So I did a Google search and found that such a thing was called anxiety. There was a fear that I couldn't pinpoint my finger at what was lurking inside me, but as long as I got distracted, I was okay. Looking back, it could be because I didn't know what to do.
